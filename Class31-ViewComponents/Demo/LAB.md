# Implementation 20: Insertion Sort

### Implement an Insertion Sort

## Specifications
- Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment 
- Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- Create a branch in your repository called `insertionSort`
- On your branch, create...
    - _C#_: A new folder named `sorts`, create a new console application and within the `Program.cs` class, create a static method named `InsertionSort()` 
    - _JavaScript_: a folder named `sorts` which contains a file called `insertionSort.js`
    - _Python_:a folder named `insertionSort` which contains  a file called `insertionSort.py`
    - _Java_: a folder named `InsertionSort` which contains a file called `insertionSort.java`
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
    - _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Features 
 Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort. 

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define. 

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
